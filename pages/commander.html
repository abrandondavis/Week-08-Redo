      <h2>Explaining the Commander Format:</h2>
      <p class="first-letter">Commander, also known as Elder Dragon Highlander (EDH), is a captivating multiplayer format in Magic: The
        Gathering. In Commander, players construct a 100-card singleton deck, which means no duplicate cards except for
        basic lands. The format revolves around a legendary creature chosen as the commander, and it encourages
        creativity
        and unique deck-building choices.</p>

      <h2>Deck Building Tips:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Choose a Theme or Strategy:</strong> Select a theme or strategy for your Commander deck based on
          your
          commander's abilities and your preferred playstyle. Themes could be tribal (e.g., all Elves), control, aggro,
          combo, or any creative concept you have in mind.</li>
        <li><strong>Include Ramp and Mana Fixing:</strong> Since Commander decks have a higher mana curve and require
          more
          mana, include ramp spells (cards that accelerate your mana) and mana-fixing cards (cards that help you produce
          multiple colors of mana) to ensure you can cast your spells effectively.</li>
        <li><strong>Include Card Draw:</strong> Commander games tend to be longer, so having a consistent source of card
          draw is crucial to maintain card advantage and options throughout the game.</li>
        <li><strong>Balance Interaction:</strong> Include a mix of removal spells, counterspells, and answers to various
          threats in your deck to deal with a wide range of situations.</li>
        <li><strong>Mind Your Mana Curve:</strong> Be mindful of your deck's mana curve to ensure you have playable
          spells
          at different mana costs. A well-balanced curve helps you have options in the early, mid, and late game.</li>
        <li><strong>Protect Your Commander:</strong> Since your commander is crucial to your deck's strategy, consider
          including protective cards to keep your commander safe from removal or theft.</li>
        <li><strong>Include a Win Condition:</strong> Ensure your deck has a clear path to victory. Whether it's through
          a
          specific combo, overwhelming creatures, or another method, make sure you can close out games.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Synergies:</strong> Look for card interactions and synergies within your deck. Cards that work
          well together can create powerful and unexpected outcomes.</li>
        <li><strong>Include Utility Lands:</strong> Utilize lands with special abilities or utility to enhance your
          deck's
          flexibility and capabilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Consider Your Playgroup:</strong> Adapt your deck's power level to match the playgroup you'll be
          playing with. Communicate with other players to ensure everyone has an enjoyable experience.</li>
