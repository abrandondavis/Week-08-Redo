      <h1>What is Magic the Gathering?</h1>
      <p class="first-letter">Magic: The Gathering is a popular collectible card game that combines strategy, creativity, and a rich fantasy
        world. Players assume the roles of powerful wizards and engage in epic battles by using decks of cards
        representing creatures, spells, and enchantments. The objective is to reduce the opponent's life total to zero
        while employing tactics, resource management, and a deep understanding of card interactions. With thousands of
        unique cards and a vibrant community, Magic offers endless possibilities for deck building and gameplay,
        appealing to both casual gamers and competitive players in various formats. Its immersive lore and
        ever-expanding universe continue to captivate players, making it a timeless and dynamic card game.

      <h2>Popular Formats</h2>
      <div>
        <h3><a href="./pages/standard-mtg.html">Standard</a></h3>
        <p class="first-letter">Standard is a rotating format in Magic: The Gathering, where players can construct decks using cards from the
          most recent sets, typically the last two years' worth of expansions and core sets. This format encourages
          adaptability and innovation as the card pool changes over time, ensuring a dynamic and evolving metagame. It's
          a popular choice for competitive players and offers a balanced environment where strategic deck construction
          and gameplay skills are paramount. Standard tournaments and events showcase the latest cards and strategies,
          making it an exciting and ever-changing format for Magic enthusiasts.</p>

      <div>
        <h3><a href="./pages/commander.html">Commander</a></h3>
        <p class="first-letter">Commander, also known as Elder Dragon Highlander (EDH), is a unique and social multiplayer format in Magic:
          The Gathering. In Commander, each player chooses a legendary creature as their commander and builds a 100-card
          singleton deck (meaning no duplicate cards except for basic lands). The format encourages creativity and
          allows for diverse strategies, as players have access to their commander's unique abilities throughout the
          game. Commander emphasizes social interactions, diplomacy, and epic multiplayer battles, making it a beloved
          choice for casual and social play. The format is defined by its vibrant community, extensive deck
          customization options, and a focus on fun and memorable moments.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3><a href="./pages/booster-draft.html">Booster Draft</a></h3>
        <p class="first-letter">Booster Draft is a limited format in Magic: The Gathering where players construct their decks in real-time
          during the event. In a typical Booster Draft, participants are seated in a circle and receive booster packs
          from the most recent set. They select one card from their pack and pass the remaining cards to their neighbor.
          This process continues until all the cards are chosen. Players then repeat this process with additional packs,
          gradually building a 40-card deck. Booster Draft requires quick decision-making, adaptability, and a keen eye
          for card synergies. It offers a level playing field since everyone starts with random booster packs, making it
          a popular and competitive format that rewards skill and strategy.</p>

        magical
        or thematic aspect of the game and is associated with specific strengths, weaknesses, and playstyles.
